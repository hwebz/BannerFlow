#What are BannerFlow Widgets?#

BannerFlow widgets are special elements, functions or animations that allows for better user-engagement and eye-catching effects in banners created in BannerFlow. Every widget serves a purpose to increase users overall advertisement conversion and to give their creatives a nice and slick look with great functionality.

##Generic usage##

Any type of regular Javascript code is eligible to be used in a widget. Keep it slim and not bloated. When a widget is packaged, minify it to make it more lightweight.

###Dont's###
* Try not to use an extensive amount of third party snippets/code.
    * If possible, embed the code inline rather than making an external HTTP Request.
* Avoid using jQuery as it adds up weight to the total banner load.
* Avoid using image sources as these has to be loaded externally, if and when possible, use either CSS or inline SVG instead.

###Dos###
* Be creative :)
